    <h1>About MiniSo</h1>
    <p>MiniSo is a fully functional, multi-page front-end e-commerce web application designed to deliver a seamless and visually engaging shopping experience. Inspired by the cute and minimalist design aesthetics of Miniso, it allows users to browse a wide range of products with attractive layouts and imagery. The platform features a dynamic product catalog, interactive shopping cart, and responsive UI optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. A simple yet effective authentication system, powered by localStorage, enables account creation, sign-in, and sign-out functionality. Products are organized into categories, with detailed descriptions and imagery for each item. The cart supports real-time updates, quantity adjustments, and total price calculation. The design emphasizes clean navigation, playful color schemes, and user-friendly interactions, enhancing both usability and brand appeal. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates front-end development expertise without reliance on external frameworks. This project is ideal for showcasing technical skills, UI/UX design capability, and e-commerce development knowledge in portfolios and resumes.
